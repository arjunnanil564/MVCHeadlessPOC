**Changes to Experience Editor Rendering Wrapper for Headless Compatibility**
**Issue**
The Experience Editor's HTML output for headless rendering was breaking due to unclosed <div> tags in the Markers pipeline. Specifically, the closing </div> tags were missing, which caused issues when rendering content in the Experience Editor for Headless implementations.

**Solution**
Pipeline: BHF.Feature.PageComponents.Pipelines.ExperienceEditor.RenderingWrapper.Markers
In the GetStart() function, the return statement that generates the HTML for the component wrapper was updated to ensure proper closure of HTML tags. The updated code addresses this issue by closing the div tags, ensuring that the generated HTML is well-formed for headless rendering. So, add two closing div tags at the end of the return statement


**Explanation:**

The original code returned an HTML structure where the div tags were not properly closed.
This led to broken HTML output when the Experience Editor was used in a Headless context.
By adding the closing divs after the notificationHtml, the HTML structure is now correctly closed, ensuring proper rendering in the Experience Editor for Headless content.

**Impact**
This change ensures that HTML content generated by the pipeline is properly closed, which is critical for rendering when working with Headless Sitecore. It resolves the rendering issues in the Experience Editor by ensuring that the HTML is valid and properly structured.
